Refrigerators
Refrigerating and eating your leftovers, they're damn good, too
But you can't be any fat ass from the deli
Gotta be handy with the fork, if you know what I mean
Eat your beans
Refigerators, open up

It was a greasy chicken leg, a side of chili
Mike B is on the streets, trying to consume
some desserts and peas, so I can get me some lunch
just rollin' my burrito, eatin all alone.

Just hit Privatsky's for an E.B.C.
on a mission to find Chef Boyardee
Seen a box full of twinkis, no need to diet
all you twinkis know what's up with lard

So I eats some kids about 21 the oldest
some kids shootin marbles so I said "I'll eat you"
I jumped out the side, and said "hello class"
Some babies pulled some grits, so I ate them up

Since this chilis callin me, i'ma chew and swallow
these bakers bakin so hard they make a delicious cake
On to bigger, better cakes than some ghetto cookies
I see some honey, and some candy in the chex mix

I'm gettin hungry, I'm eating myself
I can't believe I'm eating little kids
They taste like onion rings, they taste like T-Rex
I looked at the class, and said "Damn, who's next?"

They got my kids all baked in the oven
ain't none of them knowing I'd eat them pound for pound
I gotta eat 'em up real quick before they start to cool down
I best pull out my fork and shovel these kids on down

They got lard in a can
I think I'm in heaven
I can't believe fat is so delicious
If I had friends I'd eat them
let me fix a plate
of meat cut from my homey Nate

Sixteen kids in my stomach, and one in the mouth
Buch Dogg is about to make some food get eaten
Now they tasty and delicious
its a tad bit late
Buch Dogg put the kids on the dinner plate

I shoved all them kids down
I let my gut expand
now I'm switching my mouth back into eat mode
if you twinkis step back I'll eat you
I just took a huge crap over there on the curb

Now that I've got the food
with extra fat
before I got fat I used to run track
back up back up cuz i'm fat
F-O-O-D and me
a deadly combination
Just who I eat
they had some feet
in need of some digestive help
the Buch Dogg and the School Child
were about to have dinner
one of those kids was tasty as hell
I said "Ooh, I need some salt"
he said "my ass is real fat and you seem real big,"
"would you trim me down?"
I got a stomach full of kids and I'm fat as hell
the next stop is the deep frier where I'll get even fatter

I'm eating
all kinds of weird shit
Good Food
get in my belly
I'll eat ya
food
at a whole new deli
the case is full of meat and next to the meat is jello
Chicken
String Beans
I make
dinner
Good food
where kids are edible
and so are planets

If you eat who I eat
you don't ever get hungry
Its the good food deli
stocked up with school kids.
If you crap like I crap
use toilet paper 1 million sheets a day
and if your ass is real fat
Mike B will refrigerate you.
